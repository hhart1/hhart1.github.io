      <h1> Admirable Website - Week 1 </h1>

      <h2> Lisa Bettany's Photography Website </h2>
        <p> The designs simplicity makes this website successful.
            I like the grid layout of all of the photographs on the homepage and it's easy to use scrolling function.
            I feel like it's a website with simple navigation that's user friendly for everyone.
