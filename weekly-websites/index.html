      <h1> Admirable Websites </h1>

      <h2> Lisa Bettany's Photography Website </h2>
        <p> The designs simplicity makes this website successful.
            I like the grid layout of all of the photographs on the homepage and it's easy to use scrolling function.
            I feel like it's a website with simple navigation that's user friendly for everyone.

      <h2> Smetana Andreas's Photography Website </h2>
        <p> The front page isn't too busy and I love how the logo is nicely displayed.
            I like the vertical scrolling function and how it's easy to figure out.
            The hover animation over the "view project" commands are really cool as well.

      <h2> Tony Dorio's Photography Website </h2>
        <p> This website is artistically awesome.
            The moment you enter the website, you see a lot of different animations.
            The viewer see's a collage of black and white photos that fill the screen like a checkerboard.
            When you click on an image, it navigates to the image in color in an interesting way.
            This website might be too busy for some, but for me it's a work of art.
