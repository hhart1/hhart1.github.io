      <h1> Admirable Website - Week 4 </h1>

      <h2> ELI Photography Retouching Website </h2>
        <p> The way this website is layed out is pretty cool.
            When you click on their site, the menu bars scroll up from the top.
            Their website is easy to use, with a collage of photos that you can click
            to throw you further into their portfolio.
