      <h1> Admirable Website - Week 3 </h1>

      <h2> Tony Dorio's Photography Website </h2>
        <p> This website is artistically awesome.
            The moment you enter the website, you see a lot of different animations.
            The viewer see's a collage of black and white photos that fill the screen like a checkerboard.
            When you click on an image, it navigates to the image in color in an interesting way.
            This website might be too busy for some, but for me it's a work of art.
